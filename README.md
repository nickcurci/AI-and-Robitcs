# AI-and-Robitcs
#### This repo runs programs off the Game library. I will add that in shortly.
The programs use "AI" (decision trees, MCTS, minimax) to play simple games like connect 4 and tic tac toe.
The programs also use image processing tools to snap a photo of the board, determine the piece locations, and calculate a move based on that. 
In additon to this, the code also programs a lego robot to move and push their piece into the correct location, based on the best move chosen by the AI.
